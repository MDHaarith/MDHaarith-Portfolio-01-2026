        <p>
            Hello, I am Mohamed Haarith.<br>
            I am an Engineering student at SRM Valliammai Engineering College and an enthusiastic learner with a deep passion for discovery and innovation.
            Learning is what truly makes me happy, and my ultimate goal is to become a polymath—someone with a wide breadth of knowledge across many different fields.
            My interests are diverse, spanning subjects such as Biology, Computer Science, Psychology, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Politics.
            I am fascinated by how these branches of knowledge interconnect, and I am constantly seeking to learn more about each of them.
            This is my very first portfolio, built using my foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS. I see this site as a starting point for the greater innovations that lie ahead.
            I am creating this space to serve as a digital milestone—a place I can reflect on and look back at once I have reached my future goals in innovation and entrepreneurship.
            Join my journey.<br>
            I believe that great things happen through collaboration. If you are interested in learning together or working on a project, please feel free to message me. Let's innovate together!
